# PredictingIndoorLocationR
The primary goal of this project is to find out if we can predict oneâ€™s location based on Wi-Fi Signals. In order to do that, we will build a few models and see which one performs the best. To be more specific, we will compare their accuracy and kappa and pick the one that performs well, assuming that we are able to predict.
